TEAM CAPTURES RSA KEYS WITH AM RADIO AND CELL PHONE,8-Jun-16,10:39,"Coil whine: it’s not just a problem for PC gaming enthusiasts anymore. A recent paper outlines an attack vector for capturing RSA keys by analyzing the noises, RF variations, or electromagnetic changes produced from computers as they do intense computational tasks.

Now, Darktrace is filled with analysts who used to work for NASA or the GCHQ. This was the first step in defining the success Darktrace would soon receive.",cyber security|darktrace|mike lynch|NSA

PURSE.IO: PURSE INSTANT AND CHOOSE YOUR DISCOUNT REVIEW,"JUN 06, 2015",05:26,"For Bitcoiners, Purse.io seems to be one of the best options for spending Bitcoin for goods, as Amazon carries almost anything you would want to buy. In addition to the ability to spend Bitcoin on Amazon products, Purse.io allows you to choose a discount rate between 1-50%. However, since Purse acts as an escrow service, it is extremely unlikely that you will be able to get a 50% discount on anything. In past transactions with Purse, I’ve gotten up to a 35% discount on items that were less than $10, 30% off of items that were less than $30, and 25% off of anything higher than that. In general, the higher you set your discount, the longer it’s going to take to get your item. Purse.io works by providing an escrow service between two irreversible transactions, an Amazon purchase (once shipped, it cannot be stopped) and a Bitcoin transaction. When a shopper spends their Bitcoin, it is held in escrow until they confirm the shipment of items, at which point it is released to the buyer of the Amazon order.",amazon|bitcoin|Bitcoin Amazon|Purse.io|Spend Bitcoin

The ledger wallet is locked with a pin code, enter it wrong three times and the contents of the USB stick are wiped. Each ledger comes with a recovery sheet to write the 24 word seed recovery phrase on.

This conference brought the virtual currency world and online gambling together in an attempt to eliminate the friction in online gambling payment processing and promote the adoption of digital currencies for online transactions.

This conference has also served to start building a strong relationship between the bitcoin and online gambling communities and provided an excellent opportunity for industry representatives, investors, affiliates, and operators to meet, interact, network and share information. Currently Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies represent a very small percentage of igaming revenues. However the opportunity for operators is big with clear advantages such as providing the means to target any person worldwide with little to no friction, 0% chargebacks and positively no fraud. It is not surprising then that the igaming industry is focused on this rapidly expanding niche

LESSONS TO LEARN FROM MOOLAH AND BITCOIN TRADER COLLAPSE,24-Oct-14,3:34,"The Bitcoin arbitrage service Bitcoin Trader and the very well known Moolah exchange and escrow service, have announced bankruptcy; both the CEO´s in charge of the companies are missing. Despite all the criticism, all this seems very similar to what many times happened in the traditional financial system: the owners disappear along with the funds! So at this point there’s nothing new here, and I guess we could say that history repeats itself in many ways.
Until now, there is no evidence that these events were perpetrated to defraud customers of the service, and in fact we are not assuming that, but rather are trying to understand what the community can learn from these catastrophic failures. It could be just another business failure and an owner unable to cope with the pressure, but the most likely reason for the failure is simply that true arbitrage, with simultaneous transactions, is simply hard to execute in the case of Bitcoin Trader. In regards to Moolah the analysis is should be seen a little differently since the CEO was already allegedly a known scammer with court restrictions imposed because of that same fact. So, whether this particular saga was unlawful, unethical or simply inept, we should, however, draw some lessons from it.",bitcoin|Bitcoin-Trader|exchanges|Moolah|MTGox

VENEZUELANS ARE USING BITCOIN TO GO AROUND GOVERNMENT RESTRICTIONS,16-Oct-14,5:58,"The country’s foreign currency policy has been restricting exchanges for several years now, and since then the only legal method for Venezuelans to get US dollars is through a government agency.
Venezuelans can have loads and loads of bolivars (the national currency) and still be unable to buy the sorts of goods that many in the developed world take for granted.
Currency controls imposed by the former President Hugo Chavez more than a decade ago and maintained by his successor Nicolas Maduro, make it difficult for citizens to exchange bolivars for US dollars and other foreign currencies. Venezuelans are also limited to a $300 amount for online purchases per year, which is a very small figure in a country that has to import almost all major goods.

In Venezuela the hard currency is so scarce that dollars are traded on the street for many times the official exchange rate.

They plan on focusing on a broader set of cryptocurrencies (expect to see Bitcoin, Litecoin, etc.) in the next coming months however, to make this a rounded cinematic masterpiece.

CRYPTCOIN: ANONYMITY AND IT’S LATEST SURGE,18-Jun-14,7:19,"Firstly, CryptCoin is a hybrid proof of work and proof of security coin based on the X11 algorithm which uses different hash functions for mining. We all know hype is crucial in the success of a coin, but what is the result of hype and innovation? The current answer is simple, CryptCoin. Many can say that CryptCoin’s latest success is due to its Mintpal addition which could be the case, but the fact of the matter is that there is a hard working developer team behind the coin, and they have shown the ability to reach heights not achieved by other coins. The reason why CryptCoin has seen this rise is the combination of multiple things, and one of the most important is the P2P Anonymity instated by CryptCoin which is currently labeled as CryptCast. It is supposed to bring anonymous transactions through public and private key broadcasting. More information regarding CryptCast can be found in their whitepaper. Another feature in the CryptCoin wallet that I like is CryptCoin Commander which is a webGUI addition to the cryptcoind wallet that exists to enhance usability of the traditional QT, combing CryptCoin network stats and wallet functionality into one package. Some of the features included will be: Recent transactions list Ability to send CryptCoin New address generation Address management (renaming labels, archiving address) -Marketcap, Price, and Volume stats -Cryptcoin Ticker data from all listed exchanges. –Future update to include API trade functionality. –Advanced Pool Monitoring *Those in bold are ones that will be released later on
  Personally, I like what CryptCoin is trying to achieve. Many coins are pushing forward to try and release anonymous features for their coins, but many of them are not truly anonymous. Most notably, and one I don’t personally like that much is coin mixers as they are not truly anonymous. CryptCast seems to be a very effective way to send anonymous transactions, and more so when taking in a count the fact that it is a P2P anonymity feature. The latest addition to Mintpal bodes well for CryptCoin as it was the step needed in order to grow the coin into a larger community of users and investors. The future is bright for CryptCoin, but whether its value justifies the current state of the coin is for everyone else to decide. As always, I recommend you do your own research to make crucial decisions on investments. CryptCoin has already risen a lot compared to a couple days ago so a correction might be in order, but this was said yesterday as well. Afterwards, it doubled in price in a day’s time. CryptCoin is a promising project and everyone should definitely keep an eye on it going forward.",altcoins|anonymity|anonymous|cryptcast|cryptcoin|transactions

The conference began with keynote speaker Jeremy Allaire, Founder and CEO of Circle, who spoke on the steps that Bitcoin must take to continue its maturation as a currency. Around 10:00am the exhibit showroom opened up with many prominent Bitcoin companies present such as Bitpay, Cloudhashing, Armory, eGifter, and Coinsetter. One feature that is unique to the Inside Bitcoins Conference was its Bitcoin Trading Café. This special area in the middle of the exhibit area offered a place for attendees to buy and sell Bitcoins without any middlemen or fees. The afternoon session was keynoted by Nic Carey of Blockchain.info, who spoke on various Bitcoin stories from around the globe and some of his personal experiences from 2013. In my opinion, the best panel of the days was Moving Bitcoin Forward: Bringing Trust, Legitimacy, and Transparency to the Market. During this discussion, World Bitcoin Network host and panelist member James D’Angelo made an excellent analogy: “Flight is a very good analogy for creating a currency. Bitcoin has achieved flight for cryptocurrency. We are now hovering just above the trees.” Overall, I am very much looking forward to the second day of the Inside Bitcoins NYC Conference and hope you all enjoy my live stream updates.",
