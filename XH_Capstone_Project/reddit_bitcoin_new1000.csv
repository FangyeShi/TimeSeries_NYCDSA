Born in the UK but only has a Portuguese passport. Would I be able to cash out to a portuguese bank account and pay 0% tax?,1,9eifrr,6,2018-09-10 05:32:30,"So I was born in the UK but never had a British Passport. Although ofcourse I will be applying for one soon before Brexit. 

Anyway I have a portuguese passport since my parents are Portuguese ofcourse, so would I be able to create a portuguese bank account and just simply cash out in Portugal and pay 0% tax? 

Or even cash out to my parents Portuguese bank account?
My parents have have spent around 25 years in Portugal and the last 25 years in the UK."

Can we talk about Nick Szabo?,0,9ehqf7,12,2018-09-10 03:51:17,"The guy's supposed to be a genius, one of a few ever mentioned by Satoshi, yet he spends his day retweeting conservative pro-trump crap? For example, he just retweeted:

  
"" As a Marine & supporter of law enforcement, it sickens me to see [~~@~~**Nike**](https://twitter.com/Nike)'s ads on my timeline promoting [~~#~~**Kaepernick**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Kaepernick?src=hash)'s self-absorbed ""sacrifice"".  What an insult to all of the men & women who died in the line of duty & never came home to their families.  They sacrificed EVERYTHING. ""

&#x200B;

Seriously? Some of you think this guy is Satoshi?

Every sane person I know realizes that deaths like that of Tamir Rice or Philando Castile are far too common and can only be fixed from within our terrible policing system, while simultaneously realizing Nike is no saint for selling this bs while still exploiting foreign sweat shops, they're no better. Picking sides means you don't see the big picture. In less kind words, it means you're an idiot.

I saw that there's been some discussion of this in the past, with people saying they will judge him for his contributions, not his stance, but with everything we've seen from this administration (separating kids from their parents and literally refusing to return them, I can't even keep track of who is getting arrested when from his cabinet, the whole ""drain the swamp"" thing where he admitted he was only saying that to rally his audience, this list could go on for god knows how long) it's like I completely understand ignoring it all, but you're going to STAND BEHIND IT?

Let's bring Luke Dashjr into the discussion. I've long unfollowed him for his stances on ""correct"" marriage, abortion, religion in general. As someone who studied Christianity since birth, I can guarantee you that this religion teaches fear. They pretend they teach love, but that's the superficial. The end goal is to not go to hell no matter what, it is the ultimate fear of a christian, all their decisions are made with this fear in mind.

To me, supporting this administration shows the same type of fear derived from ignorance. 

I just wanted to get this all off my chest after seeing one too many idiotic retweets from szabo. I don't want everyone to shun them or anything, just be aware of what we really want to see from those we're going to be naming pioneers of this movement"

US govt can force these exchanges and platforms to self regulate or face sanction. Any manipulative activity should be monitored and account owners face investigation. Unless we do this how can SEC or anybody in their right minds ever approve of an ETF for this madness? No govt, financial institution or business would ever consider investing and building upon the market if whales control everything top to bottom. "

We also accept Bitcoin.  
The main idea of the business comes from the sanctions on Iran. We are cut off from the financial system and this prevents us from doing financial transactions with customers from other countries. Travelers who want to visit Iran are not able to use credit cards, such as Visa Card, MasterCard to book a place or pay their expenses in Iran. Here at IranbyBit we seized the opportunity provided by Bitcoin to solve the tourism problems in Iran concerning tourists who had to carry cash.

Bitcoin will not stop inflation,1,9ef62f,14,2018-09-09 22:20:57,"While the method of how BTC is independent of a 'Board' or controlling party (Fed, IMF, etc.) and eventually will be capped at the 21 mark that will not stop inflation. I agree however it will limit inflation to a significant degree by removing those manipulative factors. It will be a market driven inflation, as it should be.
A key factor in inflation is the age old proven supply and demand principle.  Proverbial example would be if there is only one loaf of bread left on the shelf then the person with more BTC will pay a higher price for that loaf raising the price of bread.  Likewise if everyone is looking for a house but there are only a few homes for sale. The price of these homes will increase. 
Just want to make sure we stay grounded in our expectations for the future. We will still have to compete for better paying jobs and earn more coin to buy the most toys in the neighborhood. No different then it is today."

Bitcoin $BTC Approaching All Time High Short Interest Levels,28,9ees61,8,2018-09-09 21:32:23,"Recent analysis shows Bitcoin short interest being near all time highs. For any beginners, short interest is best defined as parties that are betting against Bitcoin (winning if the price goes down). This means traders/investors originally ""borrow bitcoin"" at a higher price and then hope to cash out when Bitcoin goes down and ""sell"" their borrowed Bitcoin. Simply stated, traders/investors acquire Bitcoin at current prices and then sell at lower prices. 

An example would be: Investor shorts Bitcoin at 7K, borrowing a certain amount of Bitcoin at 7K - Bitcoin then goes to 6,500 and the short seller cashes out. They use the borrowed bitcoin to now buy back in at 6,500 (making a 500 profit on each bitcoin). 

&#x200B;

The market is viewing short interest levels as both negative and positive. On the downside, investors never like to see something being heavily shorted. It signals weakness in the market for various reasons. On the flip side, all of these short sellers have to ""cover"" eventually meaning cashing out and buying bitcoin at current market prices. Historically high levels of short interest eventually result in upward momo once all the shorts begin to cover their initial positions. Please view the attached photo to see short interest approaching all time highs.

"No, Bitcoin Doesn’t Have To Be Lightning Fast And Cheap. Here’s why.",7,9eemqx,41,2018-09-09 21:13:13,"Many people talk about how slow and expensive Bitcoin is, but this doesn’t mean that Bitcoin is a bad cryptocurrency, and here’s why.

While it is true that Bitcoin may be slower and more expensive than other cryptocurrencies, this doesn’t have to be a huge issue. There is a huge misunderstanding of Bitcoin by the public as well as cryptocurrency communities. People don’t understand the use of Bitcoin, or they simply exaggerate this  non-existent problem. Bitcoin may be slower, or more expensive, but this is an advantage of Bitcoin, not a disadvantage.

### The Use Of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin wasn’t designed by Satoshi to get around PayPal fees or to buy coffee at Starbucks. He has a much bigger vision for Bitcoin, and that’s what people miss. Sure, a $5 tx fee is ridiculous for buying a coffee, but a $5 tx fee for transferring millions across the ocean is a drop in the bucket.

If you’re purchasing a house, you don’t need extremely low fees or even lightning fast transaction fees. That’s what Bitcoin was meant to be for. Bitcoin was meant for big things, not microtransactions.

That’s what many people don’t see in Bitcoin. While everyone likes to complain about how expensive Bitcoin is to use, that’s all relative. It’s definitely one of the cheaper options for large transactions.

Furthermore, people living in western democracies may not see the use of Bitcoin. We have systems such as banks and ATMs that make transactions easy. Our currencies are stable, so it doesn’t seem like there’s a point of Bitcoin. But in the developing world, sending money is a painful and difficult process. Not to mention the hyper-inflation going on in developing countries. This is where Bitcoin really comes in, and shows that Bitcoin isn’t useless or a scam.

### Still Better Than USD.

Bitcoin doesn’t have to be perfect to take over the world. It just has to be better than USD, and it will see mass adoption. Another example of this is with self-driving cars. They don’t have to be 100% accident free. As a long as self-driving cars kill less people than human drivers, they are beneficial and will see mass adoption. Or even the simplest of examples. When running away from a bear, you don’t have to be faster than the bear; you just have to be faster than the slowest person.

Bitcoin is already superior to USD, with its deflationary aspect, and how versatile it is. Currently, sending USD around the world is a slow process, but Bitcoin is faster. While it may not be instant, it is still far better than the slow transaction speeds of wire transfers and other transfers.

There’s billions of dollars invested into these transaction companies such as Western Union. When people see that Bitcoin is a cheaper and faster alternative, Bitcoin is going to see mass adoption.

Lightning Network problem - Need money to get money,1,9ebjcr,111,2018-09-09 12:25:03,"Hypothetical question for Lightning Network believers.

""I have 0 coins. No money at all.

1. Almost all major advertising outlets like Google and Facebook highly restricted crypto ads. So lower adoption rate and no more booming growth.

2. Governments caught up with the ”craze” and want some. So tons of taxation laws are now in place when crypto were supposed to be tax haven. Losing that appeal.

3. Crypto crash happened and trust in it at its lowest so no more gold rush.

4. It is fairly complicated now to buy or sell crypto via exchanges or even getting any anyway. So not helping with adoption rate.

5. Media is all doom and gloom about crypto. They love to hate it so more bad reputation and less adoption."

Bitcoin Salt Commodities,4,9e8iwu,1,2018-09-09 03:25:20,
Some economic myths that I have seen being propagated out there.,7,9e8i6z,3,2018-09-09 03:22:17,"1 - ""Bitcoin is a reserve of value"", ""gold is a reserve of value"", ""real estate is a store of value"".

Why is it an economic myth? Value reservations do not exist! All value is subjective. A substitute term would be reservation of property. Value does not exist objectively, it exists only in the minds of individuals and the idea of the value of ​​these individuals changes all the time.

If you buy a home today, there is no guarantee that it will be worth the same thing tomorrow (value reserve), but it is guaranteed that you will have the same house or at least the same matter (reservation of ownership).

Whether or not Bitcoin is a store of value, this is speculation. This can not be stated categorically.

&#x200B;

2 - ""The more scarce, the more valuable"".

Value is always subjective. The law of supply and demand, although almost always right on probabilistic grounds, is not always true. (There are billions of people in the world if an item is scarce there is a high probability that someone wants this item.)

Diamonds are more abundant than you think and can be created in the laboratory, but they are valuable. Helium gas, which we use to fill balloons is scarce, to the frustration of several scientists around the world. But cheap.

(expensive and cheap in the perception of the value of this person who writes to you)

A shortage is not always synonymous with value. Human subjectivity is.

Another reason for the law of supply and demand is not always valid is the simple fact that there are artificial incentives in the economy (usually created by the state).

A second reason is an information. An item may be scarce and there may be people wanting to buy it. But these people do not know where they can buy this item.

In short, things are worth not because they are scarce, but because human beings think that scarce things have value or because human beings like / want / appreciate scarce things and are willing to pay for it (sometimes).

&#x200B;

3 - Speculation

The economic myth here is to think that ""speculation"" is a bad thing. Speculation is only bad when it is not natural, that is when some state controls prices or increases the monetary base by misrepresenting the stock price system and crypto-coins. On the other hand, all human action is speculation. If you are reading this text, it is because you are speculating that it serves you something.

&#x200B;

4 - ""The more work, the more value"", ""Bitcoin is worth because mining is a very costly process"" (Crypto surplus value).

The economic myth here is to believe that the price of a good comes from the labor that was employed in the production of this good.

If Bitcoin's work was synonymous with value, Bitcoin would be worth more day after day, because every day more energy is spent on mining and if we add up all the energy expended up to the present moment and compare with the next moment, we will see that the Bitcoin should have an ascending graph without oscillations (which does not happen). The hashrate of Bitcoin rises day after day and hashrate today is greater than that of December (when Bitcoin reached its historical high).

Hashrate of Bitcoin:

[https://www.blockchain.com/characters/hash-rate](https://www.blockchain.com/characters/hash-rate)

If the energy or labor spent is synonymous with value, how do you explain the value of nonminerable coins? (Nano and Iota for example).

Again, Bitcoin, Nano, Iota, Decred or any other currency is worth because people believe it's worth.

&#x200B;

5 - ""Bitcoin counts because it is safe or has a historical value"".

It may be true for you or for me, that I consider Bitcoin to have value because it is a safe medium. But this is not true for everyone. Because the value is subjective, vary for each person and varies according to time, it can not be said that the value of an asset comes from this or that reason. There are people who value Bitcoin because it is safe, others because it was the first currency, others because of other reasons. All are right. But the same reason is not valid for all the existing individuals in the world.

You can not speak for a group, majority or minority. Each has its own motives and valuation.

&#x200B;

6 - ""The market"".

The market does not exist objectively. Just like the state and other collectives. What exists are individuals exercising their voluntary exchanges.

One can not speak ""the French are to blame for the war,"" or ""the market is looking forward to the next news."" To speak in the collective, when this collective is not something objective like ""I bought a dozen bananas"", ""I have 5 Bitcoins"", almost always induces to the error or the injustice. ""Not all the French are guilty of war,"" ""not everyone in the financial market is euphoric about the high.""

The ""market"" is not something we can point to and say ""the market is there"". If all the people in the world who participate in the market are excited about the price of Bitcoin, but one is not, it can not be said that the market is excited. It is a mistake.

Individuals speak for themselves.

&#x200B;

7 - ""The market is perfect"".

Another mistake. First that the market does not exist objectively, according to which the market is formed by individuals and individuals make mistakes and are not always rational (they are emotional most of the time).

Individuals do not always make the most logical decisions, they are often driven by fear, greed or individual situations that can not be measured or known. These individuals, who are part of what they call the ""market,"" do not always have all the ""market"" information and are often misled by the price system (some caused by the state, others not).

Is there a trust less way of hiring an app developer (who can be from anywhere in the world as long as he/she speaks English) to realize an app idea of mine? 
Is there perhaps an trustless escrow payment service to do split payments with the biggest part of the payment being paid out after entirely finishing the app development?

Is there perhaps any kind of platform where freelance programmers have profiles and can be rated by users who worked with them before?

Bitcoin and Numismatic Value...Can it be applied or not?,1,9e378s,6,2018-09-08 13:53:56,"Numismatics is the study or collection of currency, including coins, tokens, paper money and related objects. I think we can all agree Bitcoin is a form of currency. 

When dealing with the Numismatic Value of currency (an external value beyond the raw materials used to craft the currency), let’s say a coin or paper bill, it’s all about rarity, condition, and public demand. 

A low mintage coin is rare. A $500 US Bill is rare.  Uncirculated versions of both are worth more. Now if the coin or note had been previously owned by Elvis, you bet your sweet ass the demand would skyrocket...

So back to Bitcoin here, I’m trying to think of a valid argument in favour of Bitcoin, or perhaps A Bitcoin, having numismatic value...1 Bitcoin being worth more than another based solely off of rarity, condition or demand. 

I can’t see how condition would be applied, so that leaves rarity and demand. Maybe one of the original Bitcoins Hal Finney received would be in HIGH demand, but good luck tracing that back 9.5 years later (unless it’s on an untouched hard drive somewhere). That would definitely check the Rarity column too. 

Perhaps Bitcoin is the first currency where Numismatic value can never be applied.  Any scenarios out there where it could be?

"Showerthought: ""The world is transitioning into computer game like state regarding the enforcement of laws...""",20,9e33xt,26,2018-09-08 13:33:49,"Our generation already knows a new kind of 'legal system' very well. Computer games. It has a set of rules you must obey. The code is enforcing every law in the game, without a chance for the participant to break it (ofc there are cheaters and bugs). You can opt in and you can opt out as you desire.  

With decentralized systems this kind of order comes to the real world and will dissolve the nation states slowly.  

Bitcoin is actually a very strict system. It is a new authority with strict laws by code for anyone who opts in. There is no court, no lawyer, no judge. The code is unbreakable and you must play along. All you can do is opt out if you don't like the rules.  

While such kinds of systems would be a desaster in a world of central authorities, they are liberating a decentralized world. Efficient, trustless and virtually uncorruptable. You just need to be able to opt in and out, which will ensure every individual is participating in a system where the rules are ones someone can follow. Just like in computer games.

What do you actually own?,30,9dzptd,83,2018-09-08 03:37:54,"I've been thinking a lot recently about what I actually own in my life. 

I have been thinking about diversifying my investments but once I think about it all it just doesn't make sense to me. 

I currently own and make payments on a house and a truck. Neither of these things do I actually own because if I fail to make payments on them the banks will just take them away from me.

Essentially the same idea with stocks, do I actually own a stock because a website says that I do? If Robin hood gets shut down what happens to my stock? What if my account is frozen for suspicion of fraud? 

In the future let's assume I have paid off my house and my truck and I now completely own both, I also have invested In gold. All of these things can still be taken away from me by the government or police on some bullshit charges or if I decide to stop paying taxes. I own my house and my truck as long as the state allows it and I follow the laws of the county that I live in.

Point being is that of everything I have in my life, Bitcoin is the only thing that I truly own that no one can take away from me. If I stop paying my taxes my Bitcoin cannot be frozen and taken from me. The police cannot come to my house and physically take my Bitcoin, they can take my hardware device and my seed but a simple rearrangement of a few seed words will make it impossible for anyone to crack besides myself. 

I've realized that Bitcoin is the only thing I own that cannot be taken away from me by anyone.

7. **Investors**

**Sending Payments** without the permission, restrictions or fees of a centralized third party.  There are billions of people with no bank account.  Now they can receive, store, and send money via a common phone.  Now we can all send payments to people in any country, without government/political restrictions.  For example, when Wikileaks was cut off from the existing banking system, people donated Bitcoin instead.  Do you want your bank to decide where you get to spend your money, to whom you can give it, from whom you can receive it?  I don't.

  
**Wealth to Protect, now or in the future.**  Bitcoin cannot be taken by force like other financial and physical assets.  Value stored in Bitcoin cannot be hyperinflated (or slowly inflated) away from you by any government or or central bank.  The IRS cannot confiscate your Bitcoin money.  Nobody can ""print"" Bitcoin from nothing in order to bail out their too-big-to-fail/too-big-to-jail cronies.  Bank savings can be and have been confiscated; real estate and businesses too.  Having at least **some** of your wealth parked long-term in Bitcoin provides an insurance against bail-ins, bail-outs, money ""printing"", government/currency collapse and other forms of fraud and expropriation.  You might not have much wealth now, but when you do, you should be glad Bitcoin exists to help you protect some of it.

  
Do you **trust the government** and/or **trust the big bankers**?  Recent events and historical facts suggest you're ignorant, a fool, or both.  Maybe you're too dumb to appreciate Bitcoin.  On the other hand, if you **don't trust** big government(s) and big banks, you should appreciate the qualities of Bitcoin which make it ""sound money"" -- an escape from doomed fiat ""play money"" created from thin air by crooked governments/central banks to enrich and empower themselves and their cronies.

  
So far, Bitcoin has richly rewarded the **patient investors** who buy and hold, long-term, and who are able to stomach the wild volatility without reacting in panic.  I see no reason for this trend to end any time soon.

  
What does Bitcoin have to do with  **World Peace?** **Justice?  Fairness?**  This is a great topic for another post.

Soooo, in the last 24hrs over $1000 wiped off the value of bitcoin.  Here’s what I think happened and will keep happening until bitcoin is regulated. 

A whale (financial institution, hedge fund or very wealth individual) shorts bitcoin when it’s on a bullish run, creates and published some FUD articles then dumps nearly a billion worth of cut price bitcoin from a dormant wallet onto the open market. 

The red candles appear and the day traders start getting jittery and start selling as they don’t want to loose the small profits they’ve made. This triggers the stop losses of sleeping half of the worlds traders, thus sending the bullish market into free fall. 

Meantime the whale sits back and watches the carnage and smiles counting his windfall from the shorts. 

Then the market bottoms out, holdl’s start buying the dip, the whale sees that it’s bottomed out, starts buying back all his bitcoin and more for a lot less then he sold it for.  Lots of profits again. 

Whale sits back watches the market turn bullish again and then repeats the process.

I’m a noob and have been buying the dip for a year and am about 50% loss ( shhh 🤫 don’t tell the wife)

In my opinion it doesn’t matter how many BTC ATMS show up, it doesn’t matter how many websites let you pay in crypto. 

Until the blatant insider trading and market manipulation is brought under control.  Small to medium bag holders don’t stand a chance in this game. 

Or I might just be waffling a load of nonsense! 

Convince me I’m wrong!

It said the market was about $6407 which was $3 lower than what I was seeing on the global average. After I selected to buy $1000 worth, the following screen showed the current market as being about $6489, a whole $82 higher than the previous screen just showed! So I cancelled the order and it went back to the market screen showing it back to being worth $6407.

&#x200B;

So when you buy on the Cash App, there is a secret ""fee"" of around 1.3% that is disguised as a market spread. If they wanted to be honest and charge a fee that would be fine, but it's marketed as no fee with a small market spread, but that is way too much of a spread to be considered an honest trade.

&#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/a/da4CEKZ](https://imgur.com/a/da4CEKZ) \-Here are the screenshots of the two values taken within seconds of each other. Feel free to test this out yourself as you can do so while still cancelling the order and not being charged.

Edit: To add to this, selling has the same spread, so the actual spread between buying and selling is more like 2.6% but it wouldn't really be fair of me to say that since it's 1.3% buying spread and 1.3% selling spread. After Fees and ""spread"" on Coinbase it looks like that's cheaper, but people are saying here that at least with Cash.Me you can move the btc out instantly (can you not do that with Coinbase? I can't use them so I can't check)"
mining using the CLI..,0,9dxbfn,9,2018-09-07 22:50:23,"hey,

my name is zero, i am very new to bitcoin, am in the process of downloading the core to an ubuntu box, and i am having a bit of difficulty sorting how to manually mine bitcoin using the command line interface.

in a perfect world, i would like to find some sample php code that mines using the cli, if possible, assuming that this is a valid question to ask... again, i am very new to bitcoin, so please forgive if i ask a stupid question..

i have done some very extensive reading on google about this, so i have done my homework before asking here about this..

i find the blockchain to be quite fascinating, and it will probably be my intent to rewrite the sha256 function in assembler, just so that i fully understand it..

kind regards,

"Hello community, I am an idiot (scam post)",11,9dwqar,45,2018-09-07 21:48:01,"This morning I got scammed out of $1300. I don't even like to phrase it that way actually because that makes me sound like a victim or that I'm on the receiving end of something happening *to* me but I understand it's pretty much just the case that I'm a dumbass and did this to myself.  

Surely there are some Elon Musk fans here. I'm a huge Joe Rogan fan but last night was the first time I've ever waited for a live stream of the podcast to start. I merrily viewed the podcast smoking and drinking alongside them. It was a great podcast that I thoroughly enjoyed it.  

Fast forward to this morning, I woke up and checked online to see what kind of shit storm occurred given that Elon smoked live last night. I checked his twitter page and saw him tweet @joerogan. That's when I saw and thought his own profile responded to his original tweet about a BTC giveaway. If you navigate there you'll see what I'm talking about.  

In short, it's some scam about sending a small amount of btc to verify your address and then you'll be sent an amount in return. I sent .2 btc, or the equivalent of $1300 USD.  

In hindsight, I may not be aware of ALL the red flags, but at least 5-10 became obvious to me within the few minutes after that I realized what I did.  

I guess the point of this post is to get that off my chest as well as to have my mistake serve just as another reminder to everyone else to THINK. One of the most basic instincts is 'there is no free lunch' but in the moment, I convinced myself 'but there is!' when I thought about BTC fountain. FOMO and greed, lesson learned, hopefully. If you message me telling me I'm an idiot, that's ok, but probably won't see those messages anyway."

Lightning: Eli5 payment channels,2,9dwe0d,2,2018-09-07 21:11:52,"Given the early state of things I don't expect my channels to immediately start lighting up like Christmas trees, but after funding 6 payment channels to 6 other nodes, and now having 2 channels connected to me from 2 new nodes (that they have funded, not me) no money is moving. My fees may be higher than others and they're probably genuinely not being selected by a payment router, but I just want to make sure I am thinking of them correctly.

If ""outgoing"" channels are fully funded by me and the other party has contributed nothing, and the ""incoming"" channels are funded by the other party but I have contributed nothing, can money flow at all? Intuitively I would assume the money can flow out (but not in) on my funded channels, and in (but not out) on the ones that are funded by the connecting parties.

Is this correct? Do I just need to either wait longer to see some action, or lower my fees? I'm fine leaving everything alone - I just wanted to make sure I have it set up right in the first place. Do I need to add funds to the channels that have connected to me so that we both have funds in the channel?

I should clarify my purpose: I am a HODLer who does not buy anything with BTC - I am simply wanting to help the network by opening channels for others to use, not for me to have low-fee payments.

Thanks for any insight."

Ethical Question Regarding Monetary Ownership,3,9dvmvd,8,2018-09-07 19:50:41,"Watching a movie (doesn’t matter which one), a legitimate (in my opinion) class lawsuit was being raised, and being a hardcore believer in bitcoin fundamentals, my thoughts turned to how a bitcoin economy would respond.  I couldn’t find an answer I agreed with.  Tell me, if a socially legitimate case for compensation arises, how would bitcoin be made to comply?"
Bitcoin Survey Suggests Bright Future For Cryptocurrency,0,9dvkri,0,2018-09-07 19:44:15,"Bitcoin’s price could be about to experience a boost after it was discovered that American students are twice as likely as the country’s average to own the cryptocurrency. This discovery was made after a survey which was made and carried out by Coinbase and Qriously.

Close to one in five students in America who responded to the survey said that they own or have at some point owned bitcoin or another digital asset. This is twice as much as that of the general population which suggests that the ownership and adoption of bitcoin could be about to increase.
Students have proven to be good indicators of cultural and technological change. Facebook which is now the world’s biggest social network was only open to students in its early phase and found mass adoption among the younger population before experiencing the same in the older segments.

Another example can be taken by observing how the internet was used back in the 80s. It was predominantly used by students and universities to share research before being commercialized. Of all the students who took part in the survey, 17% said they think their knowledge of cryptocurrency and blockchain was very good compared to 9% of the general population who were asked the same question at the same time. However, the survey comes on the back of Coinbase’s CEO suggesting just earlier this month that commercial adoption of bitcoin for payments could end up taking quite some time.
This survey does, however, fall in line with a paper written by researchers at Imperial College London in July who predicted that digital currencies are set to be adopted by masses.

According to this report, bitcoin and other digital assets will hit the mainstream as a means for paying for goods and services inside the next ten years, just as many of those who were surveyed by Coinbase enter the working world.

One in four who were surveyed by Coinbase said that they would certainly take a course on blockchain or cryptocurrency. Universities are moving fast to satisfy this demand.

According to Coinbase, when David Yermack, the finance department chair at NYU’s Stern School of Business, initially offered his course on blockchain and financial services four years ago, 35 students enrolled, 8 fewer than the school’s typical elective.
By Spring of this year, the number of students who had signed up for the same course had jumped up to 230 and this forced Stern to move the class to its biggest auditorium. Coinbase found that over 40% of the best 50 universities around the world offer at least one class on cryptocurrency or blockchain and over 20% offer more than just one.

Blockchain and cryptocurrency classes are more popular and present in the US, it must be noted. Less than 30% of the 18 international universities on the list offers at least one class on the topic. Only two – the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich and the National University of Singapore – offer in addition to one.

Coinbase reviewed course catalogs at the best 50 universities in the world and found classes in cryptocurrency across various departments including finance and anthropology, thereby proving that the courses were not limited to computer science.
In fact, the increase in offerings across disciplines can be mapped to student interest: students with a varying set of majors said they would be inclined to taking cryptocurrency classes. Almost 50% of all social science majors said they’d be open to signing up for a crypto class. Meanwhile, the bitcoin price made a recovery this week by climbing above the all-important $7,000 mark."

Why Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are always costly on Indian Exchanges such as Koinex?,6,9dv6f2,13,2018-09-07 19:02:39,"I am not very experienced in Trading, but yes, I have invested in some crypto. Previously, the price fluctuation was according to International Market. But after RBI (reserve bank of India) rules, exchanges like koinex and zebpay are keeping the price of coins like Bitcoin very high. There is almost **50,000 rupees ($700 USD)** of difference than the International exchange price.

I understand that the price functions according to buyers and sellers. But, how is it possible that even after a strong dip in the Bitcoin, there is only slight movement in the price? Nobody is willing to sell at a lower price? Either something is wrong, or maybe I don't know how they work.

Can someone please shed some light on the reason behind this? Also, is there is any cheaper or better way to buy currencies from India? I tried finding some answers, but they are all very old and does not work anymore."

In such a volatile and unregulated environment, these type of articles do have an impact (especially when they're reported through large publications like BI). I personally think the two people responsible for putting out this garbage should be held responsible for this reckless style of reporting. 

I've already sent an e-mail to the Editor-in-Chief and Executive Managing Editor requesting that these two be barred from submitting future content to BI. I recommend everyone reading this to do the same. Below is a link to the BI contact page, as well as links to both of their twitter accounts. I call on the community to mobilize and make an example of these two FUDsters in hopes to curb this type of nonsense moving forward.

"Looking to buy bitcoin, but I can't",1,9duzmv,13,2018-09-07 18:42:15,"So I'm trying to buy bitcoin right, I have 35SGD in my PayPal and I'm trying to convert some of that into bitcoin. Not for investing reasons. Problems is, everywhere I go, I need either an ID or a verified PayPal account to buy bitcoin. That's not gonna work because I'm under 18 so Im not gonna get a verified PayPal account (no bank acct.) and I'm under 18, so ID probably won't work either. I think the site Virwox doesn't need id or verified paypal, but their fees are so high and their site is so confusing, I don't know if I'm gonna end up doing the wrong thing or not. Is there a way around this? One way I though if was depositing money from PayPal into a site like BitSkins, a market for game items worth money, then cashing out using bitcoin, but they charge 10usd every bitcoin cashout so that only high cash outs will be used.

Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you very much!

Question about the 10 minute creation rule,2,9dpuya,8,2018-09-07 06:18:53,"Hi guys,

I've only recently started learning about the mechanics behind the price and have a lingering question that I can't answer online.

If a block takes 10 minutes to be created does that mean that only a max of 144 blocks can be created every day? (1440 minutes in a day / 10 mins block time)

Can a miner successfully work and solve more than one block at a time?

If so, how come there isn't a just a single miner out there with the strongest computer power, winning every race and creating every block?

I'm aware these might be very basic, but still appreciate your help with wrapping my head around them! Thanks"

The truth about technicals,0,9dpm34,6,2018-09-07 05:49:45,"I know that people on this sub dont take kindly to technicals, i understand that and im not asking anyone to put their money to what im saying, now that that's out the way id like to discuss a few things. 

#1 day traders / swing traders

Day traders and swing traders will almost indefinitely trade with technicals and charts (anywhere from 15 minute charts to weekly charts), the only occasion on which they dont do as such is with news. Now you may be thinking we've had loads of brilliant news and developments, where's the pumps? Traders will put their money with the momentum. Without a doubt we are and have been in a bear market for 9 months or so, theyre not interested in buying/long on news rather shorting any piece of bad news to fit the trend aka ride the wave.

#2 scenarios 

A lot of people will call technicals bullshit on the basis ""anything can be drawn up"", which is absolutely right, however technical analysis is a scenario, a foresight based on current evidence, as time progresses the evidence is always changing hence theres no fixed scenarios, scenarios will almost definitely always be modified to adapt to the situation.

#3 why we arent at the bottom 

If you look at the 2014 crash or any market crash for that matter its often the case that volume and price actipn are reduced massively before the next bull run, as we are currently still experiencing waves in price action (see weekly chart) i do not believe we have reached that point. 

#4 evidences

As aforementioned we are in a bear market, if you want to make the most of this situation the best thing you can do is get educated. From my perspective we are currently in a bearish wave and soon will be testing/breaking 5750 support to achieve prices of 4800-5325.

What evidence do i have of this?

If you open up tradingview and look at the BTCUSD weekly chart you should recognise that prior to the 2017 bull run there is a red candle with a lower wick of 5325 therefore providing support at that level before the market turned into an absurdly bullish bubble, furthermore if you turn on the stochastic rsi indicator you will see the current momentum is bearish, this in combination with relatively high rsi signals a downward momentum to search for lower pricing.

As always i could be wrong and this is open for discussion, i understand a majority of us here are investors not traders and this is not trading advice, however should this scenario play out im sure some of you would be happier understanding the reasoning and technical framework behind a bear market."

&#x200B;

Today I am writing a short update to discuss the origin of the funds and some events that could be related both to this wallet and yesterday's price crash.

&#x200B;

**Wallet's origin**

&#x200B;

This question has been discussed a lot by the crypto community in the past year.

Here is a summary of the most probable hypothesis for the wallet's origin:

1. a SilkRoad user or DPRs wallet per this post: [https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=310600.0](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=310600.0)
2. a MtGox cold wallet that has been seized or is still owned by MtGox: in  fact the wallet funds moved in March 2014 right after MtGox filed for  bankruptcy one month earlier in February 2014;  these movements dates  are really similar to the [200,000 lost coins ""found"" by Karpeles](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/21/mtgox-missing-70m-bitcoin) which moved March 7th, 2014 ([1dda0f8827518ce4d1d824bf7600f75ec7e199774a090a947c58a65ab63552e3](https://blockexplorer.com/tx/1dda0f8827518ce4d1d824bf7600f75ec7e199774a090a947c58a65ab63552e3)), just 2 days before the movements on the wallet we are talking about here.
3. a whale wallet since the major part of the 111,111 coins are coming  from a very old deposit of 37,421 coins processed on June 21st, 2011  making this an early adopter's wallet  ([70d46f768b73e50440e41977eb13ab25826137a8d34486958c7d55c5931c6081](https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/tx/70d46f768b73e50440e41977eb13ab25826137a8d34486958c7d55c5931c6081))

&#x200B;

Wizsec, a prominent Bitcoin security expert, seems to be pretty sure that the wallet belongs to a MtGox hodler and early investor, who is not a DPR or a SilkRoad user, per his Twitter post: [https://twitter.com/wizsecurity/status/1037030003068653569](https://twitter.com/wizsecurity/status/1037030003068653569)

Finally, Wizsec and I agree that this wallet is not CSW\`'s wallet despite it is mentioned in several court documents. Wizsec spent a lot of time debunking CSW's ownership claims earlier this year: [https://twitter.com/wizsecurity/status/968337084837781504](https://twitter.com/wizsecurity/status/968337084837781504)

Also, I wanted to report some events that could be related to this 1933f wallet activity:

* $100M USDT were [transferred](https://omniexplorer.info/address/1NTMakcgVwQpMdGxRQnFKyb3G1FAJysSfz) (reported by u/whalecheetah) while the 1933f wallet owner was in the process of transferring approximately the same amount to several exchanges;
* a [10,000 BTC](https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/tx/f2465a1225531d33696380f06034499a52d707f85ee6ae1419885980011f6e25) buy order was filed last night on [Bitmex](https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/3BMEXqGpG4FxBA1KWhRFufXfSTRgzfDBhJ) with 8,030 BTC transferred from a [Bitfinex user wallet](https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/1Kr6QSydW9bFQG1mXiPNNu6WpJGmUa9i1g) while the 1933f wallet owner transferred approximately the same amount of BTC to Bitfinex since August, 24th. Was this deal prepared or was the buyer a bitcoin angel?

&#x200B;

In the light of this yesterday's price crash, do you think the $100M transferred to the exchanges caused it?

I know for a fact that sometime in 2011or 2012 I signed up for a mining pool and ran the MacMiner app on my Mac OS X to mine bitcoin. I remember getting a wallet address - does this mean the wallet was for sure on an exchange or could it be in my email that I used back then. I got the old Mac out and tried to search for a wallet.dat file and could not find one but I'm not sure if I would have done this via an exchange or not. Any emails regarding signing up for an exchange or an ""online"" wallet. would be in an email that I don’t use anymore and I’m trying to recover my old p.w. to get access to that 
Do I have any hope? Am I searching in vain? What are the chances of recovering any bitcoin if I had that software running for approx. 6 months in 2011/2012 ?

Huge stash of dark market bitcoins on the move,3,9dkiqc,10,2018-09-06 20:52:43," *It’s a like a Hollywood movie. A shadowy figure works out out how to plunder a huge hoard of cash hidden away years ago by person or persons unknown, somehow connected to the criminal underworld. The money moves but no one knows who’s doing it – only that something big is happening, and that there are machinations going on far behind the scenes that most of us will never understand.*

Thousands of bitcoins sat in numerous accounts that have been dormant since 2014 have started moving. The original address and the activity connected to it have been the topic of an extensive investigation by [reddit user sick\_silk](https://www.reddit.com/user/sick_silk). The total value of those accounts, including BCH and other fork coins, approaches a billion dollars.

In one post he discusses the [origins of the BTC](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9bfnff/near_1b_are_currently_on_the_move_from_a_silkroad/); in another, he shows that [large amounts – around $100 million – have just been moved to Binance and Bitfinex](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ceb5v/1b_bitcoins_on_the_move_owner_transfers_100m_to/) – suggesting they will be sold for alts and USD respectively.

From the analysis, it seems that the bitcoins ultimately come from a Silk Road address – the famous dark market that sold drugs and other illegal items for BTC, and that was shut down by the FBI in 2013. It appears that the coins were ‘tumbled’ back in 2014, and split among many different addresses. However, it was still possible to link them back to the original account, which was set up in 2011, with a transfer associated with Ross Ulbricht: the ‘Dread Pirate Roberts’ who founded the Silk Road.

What Will Happen To Bitcoin After All 21 Million Coins Are Mined,0,9dk5px,2,2018-09-06 20:15:20,"Bitcoin shows some similarities to gold as an asset. Neither bitcoin nor gold can be created arbitrarily. Gold has to be mined from the ground and Bitcoin via digital means. The founders of Bitcoin clearly articulated that Bitcoin, like gold, must have a limited and finite supply. Bitcoin has a mineable supply of 21 million coins. Once these many coins have been mined, the total supply will be tapped out unless Bitcoin’s protocol is altered to allow for an increased supply. Bitcoin enthusiasts argue that, like gold, the fixed supply of the currency allows for banks to be kept in check and prohibited from arbitrarily issuing fiduciary media. The question, however, remains – What will happen when the global supply of Bitcoin is tapped out?

Effects on Bitcoin Miners

The group most directly impacted by the supply limit of Bitcoin is definitely the Bitcoin mining community. On one side, you have the skeptics of the limitation of Bitcoin who argue that miners will be forced away from the block rewards they receive for their efforts once the Bitcoin supply in circulation has reached its limit. This will make the mining community begin to depend on transaction feeds to maintain their operations. Bitcoin.com argues that miners will find the cost of this process unsustainable and that this will lead to a decrease in the number of miners, a process of centralisation of the Bitcoin network and many negative effects on the ecosystem.

In this debate, there is an assumption made that transaction fees on its own will not be sufficient to keep Bitcoin miners financially solvent after the mining process has been completed. However, there is also reason to believe that transaction fees and mining costs will even out somewhere down the road. Looking far ahead in time, it is not impossible to imagine that mining chips will become much smaller and highly efficient. This would decrease the burden placed on miners and would decrease the threshold of an initial cost required to become a miner. Further, we could see an increase in transaction fees and this could help keep miners afloat.

Price of Bitcoin

Bitcoin’s price has risen exponentially from its starting point and has lost much of its value from its peak level. It has been a rollercoaster ride that you simply don’t want to get off of.

Nobody has complete clarity about how Bitcoin will continue to manifest itself onto the larger financial world but it seems plausible that its limited supply will be a leading factor in driving the price back up. There are large piles of inactive coins that are stored across the world, the largest of which belongs to the individual or group that created Bitcoin, the enigmatic Satoshi Nakamoto. It is possible that this supply of about one million coins is being saved for a time when the global supply is faced with increased levels of demand.

"
Real reason for the dump is simple and the solution is too.,221,9dk5p9,190,2018-09-06 20:15:18,"The world markets are becoming very unstable and bitcoin was making a move from slow organic buying. The  elite and banking cabal can NOT have a hedge against their failing system so will use derivative exchanges and whales to scare everyone away.

The solution is for people to BUY SPOT btc and remove immediately from exchange so they can't take your coins and lend it to  a seller which causes artificial supply.

BUY SPOT.. and move it to wallet is the only way to beat them. "

He was a cypherpunk who dedicated his time at Xerox Park and Bell Communications Research to cryptography and distributed computing.

Why Proof of Reserve exchanges are the future!,0,9djegq,0,2018-09-06 18:55:41,"Trusting an exchange with your funds can leave the body constantly feeling feeble. Funds can be hacked, the exchange could go broke, or your keys could get lost. Finding a secure exchange can be complicated; adding together the pros and cons. There are a lot of factors that differ in exchanges, users will align with one they can trust most. Trust usually translates to a feeling of safety, but crypto is not so simple. Because the cryptocurrency community relies on trust and transparency, they expect the exchange they store with to hold to the same standards. Exchanges attract users through large trading pairs, fair fees, and secured keys. The key to trust is in trusting the exchange to put it’s users first; meaning if anything were to happen, users would be protected. One way of securing a users trust is providing them with a proof of reserve. 

A proof of reserve is a form of an audit; an audit is a means of financial inspection of assets to cover liabilities. There is a procedure in which exchanges must hold a reserve balance of the same number as an anonymized set of customer balances. The audit is there to ensure users that the exchange is covering them in case of a bankruptcy, hackings or other issues. The exchange must submit a JSON file relaying all exchange addresses and their balances, this file is then compared to the blockchain. If an exchange can prove they are holding more than 100% of user holdings, they will be approved of the proof of reserve stature. Proof of reserves is a method of ensuring users that they are covered and cared for by the exchange, this is why BOA exchange is verifying this statement to users through a proof of reserve. It may not be the perfect means of verifying solvency, but it is a step few other exchanges have taken to emphasize transparency and trust, making BOA one of few to truly want what's best for users.


Why BOA is better?[BOA Exchange ](https://boaexchange.com)

BOA is not only going through the proof of reserve procedure to brag and bring in more customers; BOA is an exchange out for advancing cryptocurrency and the lives of those using it. BOA is enabling in-exchange key storage, this will allow for users to freely access their funds without the stress of losing their keys. In the case of a hack, reserves are kept in cold storage and will be used to pay out to those who lost, cementing a relationship built on reliability. BOA also has an increasingly growing number of trading pairs, continually looking for new and better project tokens for users to buy, trade and store. Users will be able to trade with industry-leading transaction fees, remaining below the 0.1% threshold while others average out at about 0.2%. Everything BOA does and implements is to ensure users ease of use. Users can also chat to the rest of the community to find out “when moon?” through the BOA chat feature; allowing the whole BOA exchange community to exchange conversations, this is one of the only exchanges to be integrating such an exclusive feature. Whatever BOA does is based on the communities needs, ensuring no user is ever left behind. BOA will continue to work on their exchange and ways to better it, check out how far they have progressed:

If you go to coinmarketcap today you'll see the top 100 cryptos red. When they are green, they are all green (obviously not virtually but definitely a common trend). This does not make sense to me. Clearly I do not understand something. Anyone care to explain?

Goldman Sachs had been planning to create a trading desk, but due to lack of regulatory oversight has decided to focus on providing an institutional service.

Where from this does the market logically move down to this extent? Given the obvious run that will occur prior to BAKT going live and the obvious run that would occur from a positive ETF decision - what benefit is there is to manipulate the market down so aggressively?

I'm not sure I'm feeling as pessimistic as I should be right now, because this seems too choreographed to allow accumulation from very well connected parties, ready for Novemer - where Goldman Sachs could simply re-announce plans to make a public trading desk. At the same time BAKT goes live, potentially at a similar time the SEC approves an ETF. No, I'm not really feeling pessimistic at all. People should be very cautious to tricks like this right now."

Let’s take a look at 99% of the fault-tolerant consensus,0,9dezgg,1,2018-09-06 08:59:21,"  

On August 7, 2018, Vitalik published an article on his blog: A Guide to 99% Fault Tolerant Consensus.

**This theory is nothing new:**

In a synchronous system, if the malicious nodes do not exceed 50%, information broadcasted by honest nodes is guaranteed to reach other honest nodes as long as given enough time. In other words, in this case, the system fault tolerance rate is 50%. If we loosen the preconditions of synchronization and look at an asynchronous network, the maximum fault tolerance will be reduced to 33%. Furthermore, if we add protection preconditions, such as requiring observers to actively monitor the consensus process, fault tolerance can be increase to 99%.

This conclusion was made a long time ago. It was described in a well-known paper by General Leslie Lamport in 1982, ""The Problem of General Byzantium.""

📷

To put it simply:

• Through continuous signatures, time limit mechanisms and increased positive observers, we can achieve that the “truth” can be passed to honest nodes at over 95% or even close to 100%.

• In this case, the cost of stealthing a 51% attack increases, and it becomes 95% or nearly 100%.

• However when the number of honest nodes in verification nodes is less than 50% (synchronous network) or 67% (asynchronous network), this consensus cannot prevent malicious nodes from causing chain forks.

Our opinion is as below:

By increasing the number of observers in the ""sunrise crowd"" and at the expense of extending the second confirmation time, it is indeed possible to increase the fault tolerance rate. However benefits always come at a cost.

For the decision-making of the consensus mechanism, it is a three-choice multiple-choice question. They are: safety, fault tolerance, and liveness, and they cannot be simultaneously achieved.

**So to put it in an even simpler way:**

Suppose a network has:

N nodes, their labels are 0 to N-1

The upper limit of the network delay plus the time difference of the watch is D (for example, 8 seconds, which means that under normal conditions, one node information can be transmitted to another node theoretically in D).

Each node has the ability to pass a value to other nodes at time T. (A malicious node can of course deliberately delay or delay this time T)

**All nodes in the (N-1) \* D seconds period, run the following process:**

Define x:i, which means that the value sent before node i is x

Define x:i:j, which means that the value sent in front of node i is x. This is signed by node j.

**And so on and so forth…**

**Is it still too difficult to understand?**

**Let us give a real life example**

Suppose there are 3 people, labeled 0, 1, and 2. The communication between them can only be one-on-one.

0 decides one day “The target price of my bitcoin is 5,600.”, and sends this information to 1. So what 1 just received is equivalent to x:I, structured as:

Target of Bitcoin is 5600: @0 signed

And 1 will pass the message to 2 as:

(Target of Bitcoin is 5600: @0 signed)@1 signed

**In frank: “0 just told me his target price for bitcoin is 5600!""**"

The first transaction sends BTC to a test wallet of mine with a low fee.
The second transaction sends BTC to another test wallet of mine with a very high fee.

I first broadcasted transaction 1. Then broadcasted transaction 2 short after and before transaction 1 confirmed.

After 10 minutes transaction 2 was gone from the mempool and transaction 1 was confirmed. 

While I was expecting transaction 2 to confirm because it had a much higher fee.

Transaction 1 had a 60 sat/byte fee and transaction 2 had a 950sat/byte fee.

Is there a way to improve the chances for transaction 2 to get mined instead of transaction 1 in such a case?"

Bounty of social networks and bounty of blogs, plus different airdrops, allowed me to get hold of a lot of different kinds of tokens from different projects. The sums are of course penny, but in its mass it was going to something impressive.

&#x200B;

So month after month I earned tokens and stayed with them, in the hope that these coins would give the cherished X-boxes. Greed, I was attacked by a real toad and a greed for profit. I began to buy different coins and keep them until the moment of the native.

&#x200B;

Like many of us, cryptomaniacs, in my crypto-portfolio there appeared tokens favorites. In the next review, I'm not just telling you whether it's profitable or not, I'll bring real figures from life. These figures are very easy to double-check, so my review can be considered a true study."
How will we break the trend and overcome this bear market?,1,9dcugt,13,2018-09-06 04:31:27,"This isn't FUD!

I'm looking for opinions of knowledgeable people who have seen a similar scenario in other asset classes (if possible). I'm trying to understand how crypto as a whole will overcome large scale traders and blatant manipulation on its progression to mainstream adoption. I have been involved with crypto for around a year now and it seems to me that the biggest problem we have now are the whales that drive the market up and down. It doesn't encourage new money into the market no matter how good the tech. I understand how terrible the current monetary system is and the state of world economics, Bitcoin could be a solution in the long term, but there is a huge gap to close and im trying to understand how that will be bridged.

"Post-bitcoinization, a few concerns",1,9dcbpg,8,2018-09-06 03:31:51,"These concerns were put forth to me not as a concern about bitcoin, but the issues which led to the ending of the gold-backed currency era in 1971.  I have rephrased these and put them into a future tense to describe the challenges a ""fully bitcoin economy"" might again face.  Keep in mind, this is in a post-fiat collapse scenario. Bitcoin has already won.

I'd be curious to hear the thoughts and opinions of fellow bitcoiners on how we might mitigate these similar issues (or why these are non-issues in the first place, or are only limited to Gold and not crypto).  

>1. Bitcoin will become more scarce when its most needed - during a crisis, people will hodl on to their bits in fear of losing their wealth. In crisis, we _should_ encourage spending to encourage growth (as in many growth models), so having monetary flows slow down is the last thing we want. As an example, see 1847 crisis.

>2. The bitcoin emission rate is deflationary, will lead to deflation, and amplifies macroeconomic disturbance.  In order to preserve bitcoin, interest rates will have to be set high - making borrowing more expensive and hence limiting investment, again slowing growth.

>3. It restricts the use of expansionary monetary policy, as this would lead to an outflow of bitcoin. It therefore will cause deflationary shocks.  Governments will try to maintain their bitcoin reserves no matter the cost - usually at the expense of increased unemployment. Again, higher unemployment leads to slower growth and deflation, and low aggregate demand led to even further upward pressure on unemployment.

Why Bitcoin Is Not an Environmental Catastrophe,4,9d8wq2,1,2018-09-05 21:39:26,
can dandelion be implimented as a light wallet?,16,9d8vbc,1,2018-09-05 21:35:27,"since once finally broadcast to the network a TX should look no different than any other, I don't see why it couldn't be done without any change at protocol level.

I also recall some unspecified hypothetical risk of an observer being able to catch what dandelion attempts to hide (origin IP for a TX) but since that's *definitely* revealed to remote node regardless without dandelion, wouldn't that just mean that in a worst case scenario the TX would simply be as revealing as all TX are now?  Wouldn't that mean dandelion would be worthwhile just in case it works as intended even if that's not a guarantee?

Last but not least, regarding the unspecified threat to it's efficacy, I can only think of two weaknesses but am curious if it's something else.

threat #1: if a nosy adversary controls enough nodes participating in dandelion, they could potentially follow the stem even though the extended path is not revealed to any one hop.

threat #2: anyone with ability to dragnet surveil much of the internet or many large ISPs could deduce from watching packet flow & timing which encrypted hops likely belong to one stem/path

if these are the two threats, would the following countermeasure potentially have any benefits?

having the dandelion enabled light wallet que transactions for a round time (or block) increment, so that all participating nodes (and light wallets) would coordinate to unleash dandelion transactions in big bursts of network activity to make packet timing analysis significantly harder.  Could do a broadcast pulse at 1:00 UTC, then 1:30, then 2:00 and so on (every half hour, on the half hour) or every time the current block height is a multiple of 5 or something.  This would mean dandelion transactions would usually have somewhat of a wait but that may be worthwhile if it makes their efficacy more resilient to large scale network analysis.

I know IP address is but one of many pieces of info revealed with a transaction, but if you could drastically reduce the odds that a wallet address is ever reliably associated with an IP address, other things done to mitigate other information leakage could be far more effective.  Also simply hiding your true IP (borrowing another by some means or another) doesn't stop multiple wallets from being correlated to each other by all being used from the same IP, even if that IP reveals nothing else useful, so long term ips and session ips are both very revealing when you use multiple wallets even if your origin ip masking method of choice is actually working (and it might not be)

forgive me if these are stupid questions/ideas

Everyday in your life is like a block in that distributed ledger. The tasks you do, the places you travel, the books you read, the fun or pain you have are like the transactions happening in a block (approximately every 10 minutes). The morals and values of the society, country or religion that you associate with are like the proof of work consensus algorithm honored by nodes participating in the bitcoin network. Once something happens in your life, the day you lived already can never be reverted back just like the transactions in the blocks that are immutable. Just like some faces of your life are visible to everyone as your public wallet address, there are some parts in you that no one can know except yourself similar to the secured cryptographic private key for your wallet.

Just like we have many types of people walking on earth - good or bad; male or female; white, brown or black; rich or poor - there are many participants in bitcoin's network - developers, node owners, community members, traders, exchange owners.

So did RSK do it own ICO? More info inside,1,9d67hv,3,2018-09-05 16:48:38,"I so confused. I always thought RSK would just use bitcoin like how Ethereum uses Ether for gas. But in newer reports there is a token called RIF. So is RIF like a RSK labs ""utility token"" to pay for its services?
In these articles they talk about RIF:
https://cryptoiscoming.com/what-is-bitcoin-second-layer-rootstock-rsk/
https://medium.com/coinsolidation/rootstock-908392d4c7c6
Was there every an official announcement by RSK labs for this? 
By the looks of it-Bitcoin will still be be used to pay for gas in RSK but RSK labs in order to fund themselves created there own token and will accept payments only in that to help services build on RSK? 
It not bad forsay but with no official announcement by them-to my knowledge-this seems fishy. And I saw some reports that RIF will be used as gas which if used-RSK sucks then. We can only wait  and see what true and not and see how RSK does in the future..."
Bitcoin has been a better investment than fiat,2,9d5zlk,5,2018-09-05 16:21:46," I know you love talking about Venezuela in this sub but today I bring you a story about Argentina.

 In recent days the Argentinian peso has devaluated a lot, over 20% from one week to the next, and the downward trend doesn't seem like its stopping.

 I bought about 300USD/4000 ARS worth of bitcoin back in the summer. I made several purchases, first one at 15K then at 13K and finally at 8K. At that time the one dollar was worth between 18 and 20 Argentinian pesos. Today the USD is reaching 40.

 Last week I checked, even though I made most of my purchases back when bitcoin was over 12K its still been a better investment than if I had kept my money in fiat.

 PS: I'm sorry if the math doesn't check out, I've made several purchases at different exchange rates both for bitcoin and ARS and didn't write them all down, all I know is I spent 4000ARS and now I've got a bit more than that."

Working on a project and looking for some feedback. We're creating a product and platform to run containerized blockchain full nodes and making it as **user friendly** as possible. Setting up, running, and maintaining full nodes is important for the security of the network ([https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node)). Unfortunately, it's a bit of a pain, costs you money (hardware, bandwidth, time), and pays you nothing.

Enter Bitbox! A small easy to use hardware appliance that lets you run as many blockchain full (or master) nodes as you want and incentivizes you to do so. Just plug it in and select the nodes you want to run!

This has been a fun project to get rolling (and a lot of work... :D) here is a screenshot of the web interface as-is (still got a lot more work to do) and our website where you can subscribe (participate on the top menu) for updates: r/https://getbitbox.io 

https://i.redd.it/gffvdgvdgck11.png

Anyway, just looking for some community feedback and maybe some beta testers in the near future. So, are full nodes important to you? Do you run one? What you think of the prototype UI? Would you buy one of these? 

I'm excited about this project I think there is a lot of potential to increase adoption, strengthen the bitcoin (and other) network, foster lightning network adoption, and ultimately introduce and involve people that are not as tech savvy. 

Oh yeah, here is a shot of one of our early prototypes with a 2TB (2.5in) drive (you need the space if you want to run an ETH node like 700mb jeez.)

Bitcoin To 10K Again? Long Term Predictions For Bitcoin & Crypto Markets!,8,9d330v,4,2018-09-05 08:38:12,
A history of Bitcoin – told through the five different groups who bought it,4,9d31x4,0,2018-09-05 08:33:17," 

[**www.fmz.com**](http://www.fmz.com/)

The recent fluctuations in Bitcoin’s value are just the latest in a series of spectacular peaks and troughs since it was created in 2009. (Though its price has been falling recently, it remains five times higher than last April, before the latest major peak began.)

Commentators are often dismissive of Bitcoin buyers, writing them off as naive victims of a fraudulent bubble. But if we look more carefully, we can trace the history of Bitcoin through five key narratives. Each has drawn in a different group of buyers and in doing so contributed to its long-term growth in value.

The idealists

Bitcoin arose from a tiny group of cryptographers who were trying to solve the “double spend” problem facing digital money: “cash” held as a digital file could easily be copied and then used multiple times. The problem is easily solved by financial institutions, who use a secure central ledger to record how much everyone has in their accounts, but the cryptographers wanted a solution that was more akin to physical cash: private, untraceable, and independent of third parties like the banks.

Satoshi Nakamoto’s solution was the Bitcoin blockchain, a cryptographically secured public ledger that records transactions anonymously and is kept as multiple copies on many different users’ computers. The first narrative of Bitcoin’s value was built into Nakamoto’s original “white paper”. This claimed that Bitcoin would be superior to existing forms of electronic money such as credit cards, providing benefits like eliminating chargebacks to merchants and reducing transaction fees.

The libertarians

[www.fmz.com](https://i.redd.it/6eykmomnlck11.jpg)

[**FMZ**](http://www.fmz.com/)

But from an early stage, Nakamoto also marketed Bitcoin to a libertarian audience. He did so by stressing the absence of any central authority and particularly Bitcoin’s independence from both states and existing financial institutions.

Nakamoto criticised central banks for debasing money by issuing increasing amounts of it and designed Bitcoin to have a hard limit on the amount that could be issued. And he stressed the anonymity of Bitcoin transactions: safe, more or less, from the prying eyes of the state. Libertarians became enthusiastic advocates and buyers of Bitcoin, more as an act of rebellion than for financial reasons. They have remained highly influential in the Bitcoin community.

The savvy young

These, however, were small constituencies, and Bitcoin really started to take off in July 2010 when a short article on [Slashdot: News for nerds, stuff that matters](http://slashdot.org/)(“news for nerds”) spread the word to many young and technically savvy buyers. This community was influenced by the “Californian ideology” – belief in the capacity of technology and entrepreneurs to transform the world.

Many bought small quantities at a low price and were somewhat bemused to find themselves sitting on significant investments when the price multiplied. They became used to huge fluctuations in the price and frequently advocated “hodling” Bitcoin (a mis-spelling of “hold”, first used in a now iconic message posted by an inebriated user determined to resist constant “sell” messages from day traders). The hodlers insisted, half seriously, that Bitcoin was going “to the moon!” (used 178,000 times on the bitcointalk forums), and talked of buying “lambos” (lamborghinis) with their gains. This countercultural levity generated a sense of community and a commitment to holding Bitcoin that helps to sustain its value.

The investors

[**FMZ**](http://www.fmz.com/)

The last two groups that have contributed to Bitcoin’s history are more conventional. What I consider the fourth group of investors consists of speculators who have been attracted by the volatility and peaks in Bitcoin prices.

On the one hand, we have the day traders, who hope to exploit the volatility of Bitcoin’s price by buying and selling quickly to take advantage of short-term price movements. Like speculators in any other asset, they have no real interest in the larger picture or of questions of inherent value, but only in the price today. Their only narratives are “buy” and “sell”, often employed in an attempt to influence the market.

On the other hand, we have those who are drawn in by news of price bubbles. Ironically, bubble narratives in the press, often designed to deter investors, can have the opposite effect. These investors join what Keynes called a “beauty contest” – they only care what other people might be prepared to pay for a Bitcoin in the short to medium term future.

[www.fmz.com](https://i.redd.it/xzr1gkzslck11.jpg)

The portfolio balancers

The final and newest group of Bitcoin buyers are the portfolio balancers: more sophisticated investors who buy Bitcoin to hedge against wider risks in the financial system. According to modern portfolio theory, investors can reduce the riskiness of their portfolios overall by buying some Bitcoin because its peaks and troughs don’t line up with those of other assets, providing some insurance against stock market crashes. This is an emerging group, but one that could significantly raise Bitcoin’s acceptability among mainstream investors.

Bitcoin’s value, then, has been built on an evolving series of narratives which have drawn in successive waves of buyers. While mainstream commentators are often dismissive of Bitcoin as lacking inherent value, all asset market values depend on narrative processes like these.

Bitcoin may well collapse again, but so may any other financial asset. Investing in Bitcoin is neither more nor less risky than investing in the latest technology company launched on the stock market without ever having made a profit.

If you see the comments, there is another tweet by a guy whose account name is also zebpay: https://twitter.com/RaevkaRinat

He put out a tweet saying that there is a eth giveaway if you send some eth to some address. Something like send 0.5 to 20 ETH to some address and get 5 to 200 ETH bacnk.

https://twitter.com/RaevkaRinat/status/1036907038243057665

He links to this site: http://eth2321left.pw/ethgift wherein you have to choose between bitcoin and eth payments. The site shows many transactions being done. But if you see the blockchain you will see only receiving transactions, no outgoing transactions.

Bakkt: Start of another Bull Run or just Hype?,1,9cwuyr,6,2018-09-04 19:50:48,"I’m curious what the general consensus is within the Bitcoin community regarding the November 2018 implementation of Bakkt which will sorta allow a Bitcoin futures ETF under the ICE (Intercontinental Exchange). It seems like Bakkt has a two-fold purpose: (1) the launch of a Bitcoin futures ETF and (2) a cryptocurrency/Bitcoin platform that will allow you to buy Starbucks coffee using bitcoin. Let’s have a vote...is Bakkt the start of another major bull run or just a bull trap hype?

WeSellCrypto is back!,30,9cwpxg,24,2018-09-04 19:36:12,"Hi all - Some of you may have used our service previously to purchase Bitcoin & other altcoins via PayPal.

Unfortunately PayPal has not changed its stance regarding sale of cryptocurrency, but we have partnered up a payment processor to accept 3D-Secure credit cards in many regions (currently excl. US, Canada, Japan, China-- full list can be found on our website - www.wesellcrypto.com).

We offer simple verification requirements (simply email with some basic info (name, country, etc.) for purchasing up to $15 per day.  Larger limits do require ID verification, approved within 24 hours.  Once approved, you can purchase any time going forward.

Some benefits to our service:

- We do not store your coins.  Immediately following purchase completion, coins are delivered to the address you specify

- We do not see your card information.  During checkout, you are sent to our fully PCI compliant payment processor to complete payment.

- While we do operate at a percentage markup, we are priced to undercut competition on Paxful, LBC, etc. & offer 24/7 availability with instant delivery (no opening a buy, communicating with seller, etc.)

I would argue we have one of the best reputations for non-traditional purchasing.  Feel free to research around various subreddits (dogecoin, particularly) and find testaments to our consistent service for three years up until our downtime from last June.

Right now we're only seeing 1-2% of the transaction volume we previously had via PayPal but are hoping to see continued growth so we can return to at least our break-even point and continue offering our service.

If our use case meets some of your needs, I hope you will check us out.  Happy to answer any questions."

I'd love to hear some experiences from people in unregulated countries, how do you deal with taxation and receiving payments, what systems do you use etc. Any help is welcome and well appreciated! "

Casa Lightning Node and Lightning Ramp,89,9cvo5y,33,2018-09-04 17:36:57,"Hey Reddit!

Greetings from Michael and Tom of the Lightning Ramp team! We've been working on a new project and are happy to announce the Casa Lightning Node today!

The tools available to run a Lightning node today aren't sufficient to enable mass adoption. They require significant technical knowledge, aren't user friendly, or just plain don't work.

This is a problem. The Lightning network's utility increases as the number of people using the network grows. It will never achieve true utility without more approachable end-user products.

To help solve this, we've turned what started as an internal hobby project into a full product: the Casa Lightning Node. It's a plug-and-play device that runs a full Bitcoin and Lightning node at the same time. Our team focused intensely on UI/UX design while building the node software. We firmly believe this is the easiest way on the market to access the Lightning Network.There's limited availability, so jump on it if you're interested!

You can pre-order at,

​

**1. Personal risk**

If everyone knows how much money you have, criminals can decide that you are a worthy target to be attacked for your money.

If you are lucky, the attack will only be digital but, in many known cases, it gets physical as well.

This puts you and your loved ones at great risk.

​

**2. Targeted ads**

If your finances are easily followed and, let's say, sold to advertising agencies that show you ads based on your spendings, other people besides yourself might end up seeing these ads and learning what you are buying.

Even with legal harmless stuff, it might be a liking or a need that you'd prefer to keep private.

There's actually a real life example of a father learning his daughter was pregnant because of the ads that were directed to her.

​

**3. Business privacy**

For a business, having your finances transparent and available to anyone can cause serious damage.

Imagine if your competitors knew all about your revenues, margins, suppliers, the salaries of your employers, etc.

​

**4. Commercial leverage**

What if a company knew that you had a lot of money and wouldn't hurt you to pay three times the price they usually charge on a product?

They could easily show ""special prices"" for you on their e-commerce website based on how much they think you're going to pay.

​

**5. Miner censorship**

If your address is easily found and connected to you, miners can join forces to censor your transactions by actively not adding it to their proposed block.

Why would they do that? For numerous reasons, including government pressure, business interest or just wanting to see the world burn.

​

**6. Fungibility**

Good money has to be fungible, that is, all ""chunks"" of money have to be equally accepted no matter its origin.

That is the reality with cash. No one can refuse your cash or try to prosecute you just because the person who paid you got the money selling drugs.

If it weren't fungible, every bill would effectively be worth a different value (dirty notes would be worth less than clean ones) and the money wouldn't work."

A 1% fluctuation is so common that it's practically foolproof. What are the odds of me getting into the position and bitcoin never dropping 1% below that price, ever? Practically nothing?

Bitcoin Price Intraday Analysis: BTC/USD Could Attempt Pullback Or Progressive,0,9covha,5,2018-09-04 00:23:11,
Is that true that the smaller the country - the less stupid its government's reaction on Bitcoin is?,25,9covfp,8,2018-09-04 00:23:04," After more than a year of closely monitoring world's government's answers to rising Bitcoin popularity I might state that, although there are a number of notable exceptions to this rule (mostly among Middle Eastern as well as some Central American and Asian countries), the bigger a country - the duller and, often, crueler its rulers' retort to Bitcoin is. Understandably so, isn't it? In the dog-eats-dog business of people's governance, the more you are threaten - the more aggressive you behave. Here's an example of the former USSR republic (now a small, independent nation) - Moldova. 

In a period of about a year [the National Bank of Moldova](https://www.bnm.md/en) (NBM) has managed to publish three communiques on Bitcoin. This fact is already very telling about the officially perceived level of Bitcoin's popularity in this small (4 million inhabitants, 132nd place in the world) East-European nation. However, NBM still keeps its bad central banking instincts in check and reacts to Bitcoin right with accordance to country's size, which, basically, means that NBM tries to not meddle with that new, unknown, dangerously unpredictable but, who knows, may be even beneficial for country's overall performance, form of money.

In its press release, dated back to July 10, 2017 NBM's said: [*""The use of (Bitcoin) is not regulated in the Republic of Moldova. They do not represent a form of electronic money within the meaning of the Law on payment services and electronic money no.114 of 18 May 2012 and the activity on their issuance and transaction is not subject to the competent authority’s supervision.""*](https://www.bnm.md/en/content/virtual-currency-and-its-associated-risks)

Those of you, who are (even vaguely) familiar with the unnatural language with which national bankers habitually express themselves, might notice that this statement is unusual in the way it unapologetically sates the unregulated status of Bitcoin in Moldova.

Even after it was recognized that [*""Moldova’s own separatist region, the unrecognized republic of Transnistria, has adopted (Bitcoin) friendly legislation that legalizes mining and provides incentives for foreign investors in the sector.""*](https://news.bitcoin.com/moldova-with-new-crypto-exchange-and-a-token/) NBM's position remains unperturbed, which was reconfirmed by bank's officials in their two most recent dispatches - that of February and May of 2018 expressively named [The National Bank of Moldova repeatedly warns about the risks associated with investing in (Bitcoin)](https://www.bnm.md/en/content/national-bank-moldova-repeatedly-warns-about-risks-associated-investing-so-called) ... "" and ""[The National Bank of Moldova warns about high risks of investing in ](https://www.bnm.md/en/content/national-bank-moldova-warns-about-high-risks-investing-cryptocurrencies).. (Bitcoin)"".

Essentially, those are fundamentally good news for Moldavian Bictoin-holders for it, most probably, means, that their local power-wielders have decided to adapt wait-and-see approach toward Bitcoin in order to buy more times for themselves and built a system which will be able in a future to shake a Bitcoin fruits tree rather than to cut if off.

Business Notes for Bitcoin Startups Founders:

* political climate: relatively friendly;
* economic climate: not friendly;
* regions to focus: locally;
* industries to focus: e-commerce, e-jobs, marketplaces, FinTech;
* major limitations: excessive regulations, high taxes, low wages, governments control, absence of seed and VC financing, brain drainage, low-tech, agriculture orientated economy;
* stimulus: very high GDP growth rate (over 30%), low costs, little competition;
* opportunities: to bootstrap on local niche markets.
* Bitcoin (outlook): not regulated (positive) .

Privacy features coming to Bitcoin 0.17.0,160,9co6u3,34,2018-09-03 23:01:28,"Looking through the [current version of the 0.17.0 release notes](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/0.17.0-Release-notes)([Archive](https://archive.is/iVpAK)) got me pretty excited as there are some real gems in this release:

> **Coin selection**
> 
> **Partial spend avoidance**
> 
> When an address is paid multiple times the coins from those separate payments can be spent separately which hurts privacy due to linking otherwise separate addresses. A new -avoidpartialspends flag has been added (default=false). If enabled, the wallet will always spend existing UTXO to the same address together even if it results in higher fees. If someone were to send coins to an address after it was used, those coins will still be included in future coin selections.


**BIP174** has been implemented, which will help wallet developers implement CoinJoin:
> 
> **BIP 174 Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions support**
> 
> BIP 174 PSBT is an interchange format for Bitcoin transactions that are not fully signed yet, together with relevant metadata to help entities work towards signing it. It is intended to simplify workflows where multiple parties need to cooperate to produce a transaction. Examples include hardware wallets, multisig setups, and **CoinJoin transactions.**
> 
> Overall workflow
> 
> Overall, the construction of a fully signed Bitcoin transaction goes through the following steps:
> 
> * A Creator proposes a particular transaction to be created. He constructs a PSBT that contains certain inputs and outputs, but no additional metadata.
> * For each input, an Updater adds information about the UTXOs being spent by the transaction to the PSBT.
> * A potentially other Updater adds information about the scripts and public keys involved in each of the inputs (and possibly outputs) of the PSBT.
> * Signers inspect the transaction and its metadata to decide whether they agree with the transaction. They can use amount information from the UTXOs to assess the values and fees involved. If they agree, they produce a partial signature for the inputs for which they have relevant key(s).
> * A Finalizer is run for each input to convert the partial signatures and possibly script information into a final scriptSig and/or scriptWitness.
> * An Extractor produces a valid Bitcoin transaction (in network format) from a PSBT for which all inputs are finalized.
> 
> Generally, each of the above (excluding Creator and Extractor) will simply add more and more data to a particular PSBT. In a naive workflow, they all have to operate sequentially, passing the PSBT from one to the next, until the Extractor can convert it to a real transaction. In order to permit parallel operation, Combiners can be employed which merge metadata from different PSBTs for the same unsigned transaction.
> 
> The names above in bold are the names of the roles defined in BIP174. They're useful in understanding the underlying steps, but in practice, software and hardware implementations will typically implement multiple roles simultaneously.
>
> ...
> 
> **Low-level RPC changes**
>
> sendmany now shuffles outputs to improve privacy, so any previously expected behavior with regards to output ordering can no longer be relied upon.

Also sure to be of note to anyone who actually uses bitcoind for a business, though not specifically privacy related, bitcoind now features:
> **Dynamic loading and creation of wallets**

I have faith in Bitcoin.,0,9cm868,15,2018-09-03 19:11:15,"Bitcoin works.  Bitcoin is strong and growing.

What are some of the alternatives to Bitcoin?

&#x200B;

**Keep using fiat?**  No, thanks.  Fiat money always ends up being worthless.  History teaches us this same lesson, many times.  Fiat is but one step along the road to ruin.

&#x200B;

**Go back to the gold standard?**  This could work, but it's not likely to happen, as central banks have hoarded most of the gold.  Funny how when central bank hold many **thousands of tons of gold**, but they expect the rest of us to remain ignorant and cling to their fiat ""play money"" which they create from thin air in order to rob us.  The gold standard could still work, but it isn't likely to happen.

&#x200B;

**Alt coins?**  Nope.  S. Ammous has a section in chapter 10 of his book, ""The Bitcoin Standard,"" where he explains why alt-coins are not the answer.  In part:

>While it is common to think that these currencies exist in competition with Bitcoin, and that one of them might overtake Bitcoin in the future, in reality they are not in competition with Bitcoin because they can never have the properties that make Bitcoin functional as digital cash and sound money. In order for a digital system to function as digital cash, it has to be outside the control of any third party; its operation needs to conform to the will of its user according to the protocol, with no possibility for any third party to stop these payments. After years of watching altcoins get created, it seems impossible that any coin will recreate the adversarial standoff that exists between Bitcoin stakeholders and prevents any party from controlling payments in it.  
>  
>. . .  
>  
>...virtually all altcoins have a team in charge; they began the project, marketed it, designed the marketing material, and plugged press releases into the press as if they were news items, while also having the advantage of mining a large number of coins early before anybody had heard of the coins. These teams are publicly known individuals, and no matter how hard they might try, they cannot demonstrate credibly that they have no control over the direction of the currency, which undermines any claims other currencies might have to being a form of digital cash that cannot be edited or controlled by any third party.

CryptoCal: World Blockchain Roadshow & Berlin Blockchain Week,0,9cm5yr,0,2018-09-03 19:03:32,"For this week’s CryptoCal we have two new events that might be interesting for you. Have you heard about Berlin’s Blockchain Week and the World Blockchain Roadshow in Amsterdam? We’re also attending Bitcoin Wednesday, you can read about them in [**our previous articles**](https://www.cryptomizers.com/upcoming-blockchain-events-amsterdam/). If you have not heard of the other two before, we are here to inform you about these two upcoming events.

# CryptoCal #1: World Blockchain Roadshow - Amsterdam

[World Blockchain Roadshow](https://i.redd.it/j9nskjzqd1k11.png)

The group for investors and individuals interested in blockchain, created by [IDACB.COM](https://idacb.com/#about) (world largest blockchain association), has organized the World Blockchain Roadshow. Roadshow (#WBRSHOW) is here to bring chosen blockchain projects from all over the world to the biggest blockchain world capitals - starting from Asia, then going to Europe and the Arab World. Investors can join the event for free in order to meet founders in person. The founders will have strictly speeches only. Your time will be valued by organizers - so you will get new technological projects in ICO stage with special investors proposals. The event is being held on the 5th of September and will begin around 13:00. After the pitch session (around 17:00) you’ll have an hour to start networking because it’s scheduled to end at 18:00. Would you like to gain some more information about this conference? You can find [**more info here.** ](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/world-blockchain-roadshow-in-amsterdam-tickets-48878070625?aff=ebdssbdestsearch)

# CryptoCal #2: Berlin Blockchain Week – Berlin

[Berlin Blockchain Week](https://i.redd.it/oucwp5vt71k11.png)

Berlin Blockchain Week is a community-organized initiative (so they have no single owner). It is an agnostic movement based on the premise that self-organization is the backbone of the ecosystem. They invite projects, individuals and anyone interested in fruitful and educational discussions to join them. Berlin Blockchain Week is here to reduce the noise from the market and focus on education, in order to push mass adoption. BBW’s concept is simple: keep it educational, try to be as cost friendly for the community as you can and to create a welcoming environment. In total BBW wil host about 40 events divided over the whole week. There are a lot of differences between these events. They’ll organize an Ethereum hackaton, Dezentral Berlin Conference, discussions about security, smart contracts and many individual speakers for instance. You can find more info about this convention in [**this link**](https://blockchainweek.berlin/calendar/).

For those of us who are in the Netherlands this week, let's meet! After we visit the world blockchain roadshow, we'll be visiting Bitcoin Wednesday aswell! Are you with us? Let us know in the comments which of these events you do prefer and if you would like to visit another one in the near future. What is your upcoming CryptoCal? We hope to see you soon.

As always: have a cryptastic day"

What would happen if the Silk road CEO did not give up his BTC,0,9cm3z5,2,2018-09-03 18:56:35,"I am not sure how it happened. Maybe the FEDS beat it out of him. From the TV shows I watched they seized his computer in a library.  But let's say the Silk Road CEO kept his BTC private keys private (i.e., memorized his private keys ) and he didn't give up his thousands or more BTC, how would his case be any different."

"I'm loosing ""faith"" in bitcoin.",0,9clzbp,62,2018-09-03 18:39:38,"I'm tired of seeing all these youtube clowns dressing up in silly costumes  and pretending they have a way of predicting bitcoins value...    All these actors trying to pump up bitcoins validity... ""Bitcoin will be worth 28 000 in X amount of time"" BLA BLA BLA.   ""I have the latest graph with different colours so my prediction is going to be accurate...""   All of that wild speculation is nothing more than pump and dumps or surfing on the bitcoin craze for youtube views and money.

If  you remove all wishful thinking what is left is an experiment that has not made significant progress in terms of its market adoption since its infancy.  After a decade in the works there still isn't a consensus on how to deal with more than 7 transactions per second. The  Lightning Network is still in its elusive phase where its  promise is greater than anything tangible.  Almost nothing is sold using bitcoin, a few services accept bitcoin but its negligible. Most of  the transactions you guys see on  blockchain explorers are just the result of  unhealthy speculation.

Bitcoin has promising  tech but its in a dire need of a reality check.

The question is, how far is the LN development and is any company working on creating gateway for lightning network payments and converting them to FIAT, same as bitpay does for regular btc payments right now?"

"Immigrant, Maximalist, VC, Mom and my 2¢",0,9cltjr,2,2018-09-03 18:18:16,"The only thing freedom directly translates to is not being a slave. By definition, slavery is being fundamentally effected by the choices, decision and whims of others. Fiat is the technology that has enabled that to the greatest extent throughout history, these are discussions I am seeing in VC circle on daily basis amongst people who finally see it. If you are effected by government decision which materially alter your wealth, you are subservient to them.

1 Bitcoin will always equal 1 Bitcoin, but 1Fiat won't ever equal only equal 1Fiat. Government can unilaterally impose policy which literally steals from the poor to give to the rich. There is a cognisant dissonance from within VC because they missed out, they are not retroactively trying to apply pattern recognition to fund the next Bitcoin. The problem is that there isn't, and instead they are funding ShitCoins and enabling a new generation of founders who conform to their bullshit expectations. At their core they lack the empathy required to be contrarian, which leads them to protect their own ego's and inadequacy by claiming they are. That's why they are all reading the Sovereign Individual together. Literally in Telegram groups discussing the salient points.

Money evolved as the mechanism to enable the continued existence of slavery. Happy for anyone to dispute that. What originated in the form of trade was the human body as payment for certain things, what replaced it was the value of those people in coin. Where we couldn't put a price on people individually due to uniqueness, we stripped away that and made slaves who were uniformly valued. This is where money grew from.

The reason banks dispute the innovation is because they recognize their juxtaposition against it's success. It's hard to support the model that will cannibalize your monopoly, just as Kodak. Furthermore, when they do support 'blockchain' iniatives more broadly all they do is enable individuals to understand their market outside the shackles of these prehistoric institututions. They learn enough to revolutionise the system externally, Amber Baldet the most recent example (who is awesome by the way).

Want to know how deep this goes? I received an email from one of the most prominent 'CryptoBillionaires' yesterday. I had a contact looking for a large volume of Bitcoin to purchase OTC. His suggestion was I use GDAX... my reply laid out the reasons why it was critical to purchase OTC, without highlighting why I couldn't, where he tried to mansplain the reason I should use an exchange CC'ing in founder of another prominent exchange. 

Anyway, just a few thoughts. Maybe Crypto isn't the answer, but in a world where the leaders of the free world dispute the worthiness of their own intelligence services I'd be inclined to hedge with an alternative. If you can own a Bitcoin buy one because it could be your token to freedom sooner than you think.

Paying to Bitpay without Payment Protocol,26,9ckyfi,11,2018-09-03 16:07:40,"Hello everyone, 
I recently found a lot of people struggling to use Bitpay's Payment Protocol implementation. It was a while since they announced it and there were some solutions (decoders). But the problem with them is that they can just show you the wrong address/amount and there is no way for you to verify it.

I'm going to show you how to get the address/amount yourself. 

Its quite simple. When you get payment gateway, you need to get the link from there. 
Then you need to send a GET request to that link with header: ""Accept"" and value ""application/payment-request"" 
You will get JSON response with the address and amount required to pay. Now, not everyone is in tech business and knows how to do that. 
You will need a free tool called Postman. Download it and from there it should be straightforward.  

Example: https://i.imgur.com/Qoy71hJ.png

Not a lot of wallets support BIP 70 yet, and I don't see why should anyone whose wallet don't support that switch to another one just to make payments to Bitpay. 
Hope I've helped someone out :) "
